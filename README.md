This project was our Hackdata 3.0 and then it was further extended to our Introduction to Database Systems Project. We build a proper chatbot that tells the person's current mood by clicking a picture and suggests random activities according to his/her mood. For this we designed a novel Content boosted Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation system to counter Depression among all ages by suggesting them activities based on Mood, Gender, Age etc. We also did Sentiment Analysis on all his chats and displayed a graph according to the score obtained. <br/>
Moreover data collected from users as ratings is used along with identifying similar users to predict the activity a new user would like. Combining the best features of the two approaches(Content and Collaborative based), the Hybrid Model automatically suggests highly personalized Recommendations. <br/>

Also, We used <b>FIREBASE</b> to maintain a proper database of all his personal information, his mood related features, his/her chats for sentiment analysis, His all ratings and the activity that was suggested to him/her to predict whether it was engaging or not and whether he was interested or not.
